    """a function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.

    Requirements:
    - my_list can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
    - All integers have to be printed on the same line followed by a new line
        - other type of value in the list must be skipped (in silence).
    - x represents the number of elements to access in my_list
    - x can be bigger than the length of my_list
        - if itâ€™s the case, an exception is expected to occur
    - You have to use try: / except:
    - You have to use "{:d}".format() to print an integer
    - You are not allowed to import any module
    - You are not allowed to use len()

    Returns
    - the real number of integers printed
